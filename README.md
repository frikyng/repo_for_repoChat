Complementary tool_box to the microscope_controller. This toolbox is designed to handle multiple arboreal_scans objects belonging to a same experiment in order to do analysis across multiple recordings.

This tools contains tools to help curate and extract large dataset. it will help organize arboreal_scan objects into arboreal_scan_experiment objects.

It enable detrending, smoothing and normalization of imaging data across multiple recordings.

It contains tools to manipulate and align behavioural metrics with the imaging data, and extract data from specific behavioural bouts

The arboreal_scan_experiment object has multiple analysis methods that includes event detection and extraction, spine detection, correlation, dimensionality reduction and machine learning to correlate imaging and behavioural data.
